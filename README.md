This is the backend for my food ordering website, like Uber Eats, made to show off my full stack skills. You can view the frontend on my GitHub or bypressing [here](https://github.com/7seinfa/Food-Ordering-Application-Frontend/).

The backend is finished, and I used the following:
- Spring Boot 3
- MySQL for data storage
- JWT & Spring Security to protect data and information
